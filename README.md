# Places I've Been

This application was built using React with Redux and a Rails API, available at [https://github.com/jessicagomesng/places-ive-been-backend](https://github.com/jessicagomesng/places-ive-been-backend). This application enables wanderlusters to log the conuntries they've visited across Europe, as well as to add pins to log memories from places they've traveled to! 

## Getting Started

To get started, fork and clone this repo, as well as the backend repo. Then, in this respository, run:

### `npm install`

to install any dependencies. Once installed, you can then run:

### `npm start`

to start the server! If not automatic, then navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. 

Follow the instructions through the backend README to get the server set up. 

From the application homepage, the user may:
* View and click on different countries on a world map to 'visit' them
* Drop pins at different locations on a map and save images from their Facebook/Instagram/other links to those pins to record memories to look back on later
* Edit and delete existing pins
